Of course, the size of the difference would depend on such factors as the sample sizes involved, the precision of our light meter, and the memories of our patients. Even after taking all of these factors into account, there will still be observed differences, and we will need to quantify the magnitude of these. The magnitude of the difference is expressed as the probability that such a difference could have occurred by chance alone under the null hypothesis. This probability is called the p-value. The p-value is a measure of how unusual the observed outcome would be if all the conditions of the null hypothesis were valid. The p-value is also known as the significance level, or statistical significance.   pp p Statistical significance is the probability that such an outcome could have occurred by chance alone, under the null hypothesis. In this case, a small p-value suggests that perhaps the null hypothesis is not the correct explanation for the observed data. Notice that the p-value is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true. This is a common misconception. The p-value is a measure of how tolerant we may be of unusual outcomes. This tolerance will vary depending on the circumstances. p pp p p  Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative is true. p.05.05 201 : p true  11.1 Binomial test 11.1.1 Mathematical Formula The Hzpothesis is \\[{\\displaystyle H_{0}:\\pi =\\pi _{0}}\\] For Large samples we have \\[{\\displaystyle Z={\\frac {k-n\\pi }{\\sqrt {n\\pi (1-\\pi )}}}}\\] The continuity correction is an adjustment that is made when a discrete distribution is approximated by a continuous distribution: \\[{\\displaystyle Z={\\frac {k-n\\pi \\pm {\\frac {1}{2}}}{\\sqrt {n\\pi (1-\\pi )}}}}\\] 11.1.2 R implementation Package binom can provide different binomial CI and Test such as exact - Pearson-Klopper method.

Comparing to the contingency chi-square test, Fishers exact test is to exaclty calculate the p-value rather than being based on an asymptotic approximation. 11.2.1 Introduction Hypotheses The hypotheses of the Fishers exact test are the same than for the Chi-square test, that is: \\(H_0\\): the variables are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables. Knowing the value of one variable does not help to predict the value of the other variable \\(H_1\\): the variables are dependent, there is a relationship between the two categorical variables.

But when the data are dependent, McNemars test is more appropiate. t is applied to 2 Ã— 2 contingency tables with a dichotomous trait, with matched pairs of subjects, to determine whether the row and column marginal frequencies are equal (that is, whether there is marginal homogeneity). The test is applied to a \\(2 \\times 2\\) contingency table, which tabulates the outcomes of two tests on a sample of \\(N\\) subjects, as follows. \\[ \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \\hline &amp; Test 2 positive &amp; Test 2 negative &amp; Row total \\\\ \\hline Test 1 positive &amp; $a$ &amp; $b$ &amp; $a+b$ \\\\ \\hline Test 1 negative &amp; $c$ &amp; $d$ &amp; $c+d$ \\\\ \\hline Column total &amp; $a+c$ &amp; $b+d$ &amp; $N$ \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\] The null hypothesis of marginal homogeneity states that the two marginal probabilities for each outcome are the same, i.e. \\(p_{a}+p_{b}=p_{a}+p_{c}\\) and \\(p_{c}+p_{d}=p_{b}+p_{d}\\) The null and alternative hypotheses are \\(H_{0}: p_{b}=p_{c}\\) \\(H_{1}: p_{b} \\neq p_{c}\\) The McNemar test statistic is: \\[ \\chi^{2}=\\frac{(b-c)^{2}}{b+c} \\] Under the null hypothesis, with a sufficiently large number of discordants (cells b and c), \\(\\chi^{2}\\) has a chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom. If the \\(\\chi^{2}\\) result is significant, this provides sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, in favour of the alternative hypothesis that \\(p_{b} \\neq p_{c}\\), which would mean that the marginal proportions are significantly different from each other. 11.3.2 SAS Implementation proc freq data=athelete; title &quot;McNemar&#39;s test for Paired Samples&quot;; tables treatX*treatY /agree expected norow nocol nopercent; run; 11.3.3 R Implementation set.seed(150) data &lt;- data.frame(before = sample(c(&quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Negative&quot;), 300, replace = TRUE), after = sample(c(&quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Negative&quot;), 300, replace = TRUE)) ### contingency table table(data$before, data$after) ## ## Negative Positive ## Negative 13 49 ## Positive 55 183 mcnemar.test(table(data$before, data$after)) ## ## McNemar&#39;s Chi-squared test with continuity correction ## ## data: table(data$before, data$after) ## McNemar&#39;s chi-squared = 0.24038, df = 1, p-value = 0.6239 11.4 CochranMantelHaenszel Test McNemarCMH Treatment No treatment Row total Title Case Ai Bi N1i Controls Ci Di N2i Column total M1i M2i Ti The common odds-ratio of the K contingency tables is defined as: \\[{\\displaystyle R={{\\sum _{i=1}^{K}{{A_{i}D_{i}} \\over T_{i}}} \\over {\\sum _{i=1}^{K}{{B_{i}C_{i}} \\over T_{i}}}},}\\] The null hypothesis is that there is no association between the treatment and the outcome.

When the assumptions are not met, other methods are possible based on the two samples: Two dependent samples and follow Normal distribution, suggest Paired T-test; Two independent samples and does not follow Normal distribution, suggest WMW test; Two dependent samples and does not follow Normal distribution, suggest Signed Rank test; Two-sample t-test for unpaired data \\[\\mathrm{H}_{0}: \\mu_{1}=\\mu_{2}\\] \\[\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{a}}: \\mu_{1} \\neq \\mu_{2}\\] Test Statistic: \\[T=\\frac{\\bar{Y}_{1}-\\bar{Y}_{2}}{\\sqrt{s_{1}^{2} / N_{1}+s_{2}^{2} / N_{2}}}\\] where \\(N_{1}\\) and \\(N_{2}\\) are the sample sizes, \\(\\bar{Y}_{1}\\) and \\(\\bar{Y}_{2}\\) are the sample means, and \\(s_{1}^{2}\\) and \\(s_{2}^{2}\\) are the sample variances. If equal variances are assumed, then the formula reduces to: \\[ T=\\frac{\\bar{Y}_{1}-\\bar{Y}_{2}}{s_{p} \\sqrt{1 / N_{1}+1 / N_{2}}} \\] where \\[ s_{p}^{2}=\\frac{\\left(N_{1}-1\\right) s_{1}^{2}+\\left(N_{2}-1\\right) s_{2}^{2}}{N_{1}+N_{2}-2} \\] Reject the null hypothesis that the two means are equal if \\[ |T|&gt;t_{1-\\alpha / 2, v} \\] where \\(t_{1-\\alpha / 2, v}\\) is the critical value of the \\(\\underline{\\underline{d} \\text { dstribution with }} v\\) degrees of freedom where \\[ v=\\frac{\\left(s_{1}^{2} / N_{1}+s_{2}^{2} / N_{2}\\right)^{2}}{\\left(s_{1}^{2} / N_{1}\\right)^{2} /\\left(N_{1}-1\\right)+\\left(s_{2}^{2} / N_{2}\\right)^{2} /\\left(N_{2}-1\\right)} \\] If equal variances are assumed, then \\(v=N_{1}+N_{2}-2\\) Paired Samples t Test The test statistic for the Paired Samples t Test, denoted \\(t\\), follows the same formula as the one sample \\(t \\mathrm{te}\\) \\[ t=\\frac{\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{diff}}-0}{s_{\\bar{x}}} \\] where \\[ s_{\\bar{x}}=\\frac{s_{\\mathrm{diff}}}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] where \\(\\bar{x}_{\\text {diff }}=\\) Sample mean of the differences \\(n=\\) Sample size (i.e., number of observations) \\(s_{\\text {diff }}=\\) Sample standard deviation of the differences \\(s_{\\bar{x}}=\\) Estimated standard error of the mean \\((s / \\operatorname{sqrt}(n))\\) 11.6.2 SAS implementation roc ttest data=read sides=2 alpha=0.05 h0=0; title &quot;Two sample t-test example&quot;; class method; var grade; run; 11.6.3 R implementation ## One Sample t-test t.test(X, mu= 1, alternative=&quot;two.sided&quot;, conf.level=0.95)$conf.int ## Two Sample t-test t.test(A, B,var.equal=TRUE, paired=TRUE) ## GauÃŸ Test (Bekannt Variance) mu0 &lt;- 0 alpha &lt;- 0.05 # (zweiseitig): sigma &lt;- 1 unten &lt;- qnorm(alpha/2,mean=mu0,sd=(sigma)/(sqrt(n))) oben &lt;- qnorm(1-alpha/2,mean=mu0,sd=(sigma)/(sqrt(n))) ## T Test (Unbekannt Variance) mu1 &lt;- 1 tcr &lt;- qt(p=1-alpha, df=n-1) ncp1 &lt;- abs(mu1-mu0)*sqrt(n)/sigma power &lt;- 1-pt(q=tcr, df=n-1, ncp=ncp1) 11.7 Normality test Checking the assumptionof Normality is necessary for many statistical methods. For example two sample t test or ANOVA. In this section we introduce some common ways to access normality: the normal probability plot and test statistics. The normal probabiltiy plot, QQplot creates quantile-quantile plots and compares ordered variable values with quantiles of a specific theoretical distribution. If the data distribution matches the theoretical distribution, the points on the plot form a linear pattern. In SAS, there are four test statistics for detecting the presence of non-normality, namely, the Shapiro-Wilk (Shapiro &amp; Wilk, 1965), the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Cramer von Mises test, and the Anderson-Darling test. Details and discussions are given below. For example, in the two sample t test example , the assumption is the variables are normal. 11.7.1 SAS implementation proc univariate data=read normal; qqplot grade /Normal(mu=est sigma=est color=red l=1); by method; run; 11.7.2 R implementation Shapiro-Wilk Test shapiro.test(X2) "]]
