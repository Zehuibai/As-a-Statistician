There are 4 different model avaliable beta regression, zero-inflated beta regression (if zero is included in the range), one-inflated beta regression (if one is a possible observation), and zero-one-inflated beta regression (where both zero and one may be observed). 21.7.1 Beta Regression 21.7.2 Zero-inflated Beta Regression 21.7.3 One-inflated Beta Regression 21.7.4 Zero-one-inflated Beta Regression "]
