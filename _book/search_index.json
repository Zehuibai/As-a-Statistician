Due to special aspects of particular studies, additional demands might be required to specify evaluable study subjects. These demands need to be formulated in the study protocol (for example replacement of very early excluded subjects, target criteria evaluation in case of early withdrawal) or SAP, or they may be defined in a data review meeting. Furthermore, it needs to be clearly differentiated between protocol deviation classification (major/minor) during the trial, which are primarily generated by the monitoring and data management team, and the final classification that is used for the allocation to analysis sets. The final classification has to be used for the allocation of subjects to analysis sets, if absence of major (or critical) protocol deviations are a determining factor.   SAP /  38.1.3 Analysis Sets 38.1.3.1 Full-Analysis-Set (FAS) The Full-Analysis-Set should include all randomized trial participants. They will be analyzed as randomized according to the Intention-To-Treat (ITT) principle. Basically, this implies evaluating all trial subjects within their allocated treatment group, regardless of whether they changed the treatment group, refused or discontinued the therapy, or other violations of the protocol occurred. The accurate definition of the Full-Analysis-Set is described in the study protocol or in the statistical analysis plan in compliance with ICH guideline E9. Imputation techniques may be required to substitute missing values of important variables. The applied imputation methods should be defined in the study protocol or statistical analysis plan. It is possible to define the FAS by means of a modified ITT (mITT) principle. The mITT population is a subset of the FAS population and allows exclusion of randomized subjects in a justified way (e.g. patients deemed ineligible after randomization and patients who never started treatment or received less than a specified minimum amount of the intended intervention). 38.1.3.2 Per-Protocol-Set (PPS) The Per-Protocol-Set is defined as the group of trial subjects, in which no (major/critical) protocol deviations occurred, which were treated according to the protocol and all examinations required to evaluate the studys objectives were completed. The definition of the PPS therefore is highly dependent on the conditions of a specific trial. The PPS is a subset of the FAS. Subjects who have been treated and reported to a certain degree of compliance with the protocol in all essential aspects of the trial may be analyzed in the PPS. This should be discussed and described in the statistical analysis plan. The detailed reasons for excluding subjects from the PPS should be fully defined. In blinded studies this should happen prior to unblinding. 38.1.3.3 Safety-Evaluation-Set (SES) The Safety-Evaluation-Set generally consists of all enrolled subjects who received study treatment at least once. The Safety-Evaluation-Set should be defined in the study protocol or in the statistical analysis plan and should be used as the primary analysis set for all safety evaluations. 38.1.4 Randomization 38.1.4.1 Simple randomization Randomization based on a single sequence of random assignments is known as simple randomization. --33 set.seed(888) treatment &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) simple.list &lt;- sample(treatment, 20, replace=TRUE) cat(simple.list,sep=&quot;\\n&quot;) ## B ## A ## A ## A ## A ## A ## A ## B ## A ## B ## B ## B ## A ## A ## A ## A ## A ## B ## A ## A table(simple.list) ## simple.list ## A B ## 14 6 38.1.4.2 Block randomization The block randomization method is designed to randomize subjects into groups that result in equal sample sizes. This method is used to ensure a balance in sample size across groups over time. Blocks are small and balanced with predetermined group assignments, which keeps the numbers of subjects in each group similar at all times. The block size is determined by the researcher and should be a multiple of the number of groups (i.e., with two treatment groups, block size of either 4, 6, or 8). Blocks are best used in smaller increments as researchers can more easily control balance. 468 After block size has been determined, all possible balanced combinations of assignment within the block (i.e., equal number for all groups within the block) must be calculated. Blocks are then randomly chosen to determine the patients assignment into the groups.  Example 4 461. AABB, 2. ABAB, 3. ABBA, 4. BAAB, 5. BABA, 6.

This method can be used to achieve balance among groups in terms of subjects baseline characteristics (covariates). Specific covariates must be identified by the researcher who understands the potential influence each covariate has on the dependent variable. Stratified randomization is achieved by generating a separate block for each combination of covariates, and subjects are assigned to the appropriate block of covariates. After all subjects have been identified and assigned into blocks, simple randomization is performed within each block to assign subjects to one of the groups.  \\[ \\begin{array}{|l|c|c|} \\hline \\text { Stratum } &amp; \\text { Age Group } &amp; \\text { Severity Score } \\\\ \\hline 1 &amp; \\geq 50 \\text { years } &amp; \\geq 7 \\\\ \\hline 2 &amp; &lt;50 \\text { years } &amp; \\geq 7 \\\\ \\hline 3 &amp; \\geq 50 \\text { years } &amp; &lt;7 \\\\ \\hline 4 &amp; &lt;50 \\text { years } &amp; &lt;7 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] over50.severe.list &lt;- blockrand(n=100, num.levels = 2, block.sizes = c(1,2,3,4), stratum=&#39;Over 50, Severe&#39;,id.prefix=&#39;O50_S&#39;, block.prefix=&#39;O50_S&#39;) headtail(over50.severe.list) ## id stratum block.id block.size treatment ## 1 O50_S001 Over 50, Severe O50_S01 4 A ## 2 O50_S002 Over 50, Severe O50_S01 4 B ## 3 O50_S003 Over 50, Severe O50_S01 4 B ## 4 O50_S004 Over 50, Severe O50_S01 4 A ## ... &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ... &lt;NA&gt; ## 99 O50_S099 Over 50, Severe O50_S21 8 B ## 100 O50_S100 Over 50, Severe O50_S21 8 B ## 101 O50_S101 Over 50, Severe O50_S21 8 A ## 102 O50_S102 Over 50, Severe O50_S21 8 A 38.2 Phase I Trials Design 38.2.1 Introduction The primary aims of Phase 1 Clinical Trials are to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a compound. Trials have historically been conducted in the logical sequence of single ascending dose, multiple ascending dose, examination of preliminary effect of food on exposure, and potential drug-drug interaction, with assessments to determine the effect of gender, age, bioavailability and bioequivalence performed as necessary. Additional studies may be performed, including definitive electrocardiogram (ECG) investigations to thoroughly evaluate the QT/QTc prolongation potential of a compound, which can increase the risk of potentially fatal proarrhythmias. 1PK)   ECGQT / QTc 38.2.1.1 Single ascending dose Single ascending dose These are studies in which a small group of subjects receive a single dose of the compound in a clinical setting, usually a Clinical Research Unit (CRU). Close safety monitoring and usually PK assessments are performed for a predetermined time. If the compound is deemed to be well tolerated, and the PK data are broadly as expected, dose escalation occurs, either within the same group or a further group of healthy subjects, according to the approved protocol. Dose escalation usually continues until the maximum dose has been attained per the protocol unless predefined maximum exposure is reached or intolerable side effects become apparent. Additionally, dose escalation may be discontinued (or may proceed more cautiously than planned) if there is evidence of a supra-proportional relationship between dose and exposure, such that exposures at higher dose levels become difficult to predict. CRUPKPK Studies usually include sequential groups in a parallel design for maximum exposure or are of a crossover design to provide more information on dose linearity. To minimize the effect of bias, subjects are usually randomly assigned to treatment using computer generated randomization codes produced by Statisticians. Studies are usually placebo controlled to determine whether effects observed are due to the study drug or environmental conditions, and are often conducted in a single (subject) blinded manner to allow informed decision on dose escalation, with safety and PK data being available for investigator review. PK 38.2.1.2 Multiple ascending dose These studies are conducted to elucidate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple doses of the compound, again usually in a CRU (Clinical Research Unit). The dose levels and dosing intervals (ie, time between consecutive doses) are selected as those that are predicted to be safe from single dose data. Samples are collected and analyzed to allow the determination of PK profiles and a better understanding of how the drug is processed by the body; with multiple dosing, a key part of the PK analysis is to identify if accumulation of the drug occurs. As for single ascending dose studies, dose escalation proceeds according to the protocol assuming strict safety and PK criteria are met. Dose levels and dosing frequency are chosen to achieve therapeutic drug levels within the systemic circulation that are maintained at steady state for several days to allow appropriate safety parameters to be monitored. It is usual for 2 3 dose levels to be studied, at and above the expected therapeutic dose level(s) to determine the safety margin for repeat dose administration.

At least the primary System Organ Class (SOC) as well as the Preferred Term (PT) will be available for the statistical analysis. Incidences of AEs will be summarized by intensity and relationship to the study drug. For each treatment, descriptive statistics will be calculated for plasma concentration of niclosamide at each applicable time point specified, and for the derived plasma PK parameters.

To not only correct the refractive error but also to alter the spherical aberration, e.g. for the compensation of presbyopia, the subject method is inducing a change of the effective refractive power over pupil size. Therefore, the aim of this clinical investigation is to combine a non-linear corneal aspheric ablation profile with micro-anisometropia. Inducing such a change in the refractive properties of the cornea leads to an increased depth of field, if the postoperative spherical aberrations are kept within the therapeutic range.   The treatment method is intended for refractive corrections by creating and then surgically removing intrastromal lenticules.  38.3.2.2 Primary Objective The main objective is to investigate the safety and efficacy of small incision lenticule extraction combined with a non-linear corneal aspheric profile and micro-anisometropia. The modification of the spherical aberration is intended to extend the depth of field in each eye and therefore enable improved binocular vision at all distances. Primary endpoints Endpoints on SAFETY: The loss of more than 2 lines of CDVA at months postoperative compared to the baseline visit for an eye. Endpoints on EFFECTIVENESS: Patients with binocular UDVA of 20/20 or better and at the same time a UNVA of 20/32 (J3) or better at 3 months postoperatively. 38.3.2.3 Statistical Analysis 38.3.3 LOTAB A Prospective, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Finding Phase-II Study for the Efficacy and Safety of LAIS® House Dust Mites Sublingual Tablets in Patients with Mite-Induced Allergic RhinoConjunctivitis Without or With Controlled Asthma using a Titrated Nasal Provocation Test model IILAIS®  38.3.3.1 Study Design subjects with mites-induced Allergic Rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) without or with controlled asthma double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, four-arm Treatment group 1: 0 UA once daily (placebo) Treatment group 2: 1,000 UA once daily (verum) Treatment group 3: 10,000 UA once daily (verum) Treatment group 4: 30,000 UA once daily (verum) This is a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, four-arm, parallel-group, dose-finding phase-II study in subjects with mites-induced Allergic Rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) without or with controlled asthma using a titrated nasal provocation test model. There will be three verum and one placebo group with once daily (o.d.) dosing over 48 to 56 weeks. Overall, 11 Visits (V0 to V10) and 3 Phone Calls (PC1 to PC3) are planned in this study. IIARC  3verumod.d.4856 11V0V103PC1PC3 Blinding Since this is a double-blind study, investigators, site staff and subjects will be blind to the treatment allocation. That means neither the subjects nor the investigators and site staff know whether a subject is in one of the verum groups or in the placebo group. This shall prevent biased results that may arise from the knowledge of the treatment code. Breaking of this code is only valid under certain circumstances as described in the corresponding section of the study protocol.  verum   38.3.3.2 Primary Objective The objective of this study is to find the optimal effective and safe dose of LAIS® mites sublingual tablets for sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). All efficacy and safety assessments will be taken into account for the decision. Thus, there is no statistical criterion for selection of the optimal dose. Efficacy: To evaluate the efficacy of different doses of LAIS® mites sublingual tablets once daily for sublingual immunotherapy after 48 to 56 weeks of treatment based on Lebels Symptoms Score following a titrated nasal provocation test (TNPT).

In order to account for the multiple confirmatory tests, the hypotheses H11 to H13 defined in Section 2.5 will be hierarchically ordered and they will be tested individually in the order H11 (30,000 AU  0 AU) to H13 (1,000 AU  0 AU), each on the same significance level  = 1 = 2 = 3 = 5%; as long as the former null hypothesis H0k is rejected. If a null hypothesis H0k is not rejected, all subsequent hypotheses will be tested exploratory and no confirmatory claims can be based on the results. The described hierarchical test procedure is considered to be suitable as it is expected that the difference to the placebo group between the verum groups increases with dose. Due to this hierarchical testing approach, no multiple comparison correction must be applied to the significance level . Only the analysis of the primary endpoint will be of confirmative character, all other tests and confidence intervals (CIs) will be of exploratory character only. No confirmatory conclusions will be drawn from the exploratory analyses. verum30,000 AU 10,000 AU 1,000 AU0 AU2.5H11H13H1130,000 AU0 AUH131,000 AU0 AU=1=2=3= 5H0kH0kVerum CI 38.3.3.5 Statistical Analysis The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model described in the protocol is extended to a linear mixed model ANCOVA accounting for repeated measurements by addition of the fixed effects Visit and the corresponding treatment group-visit interaction. treatment arm, visit as well as the interaction between treatment duration and treatment arm are used as fixed effects. The mean LSS at baseline is used as covariate. subject as random effect. An unstructured covariance matrix is assumed. Denominator degrees of freedom for the tests of fixed effects will be determined based on the Kenward-Roger approximation. In case of no missing data, the results obtained by both models should only differ to a negligible amount. In case of missing data, however, the mixed model usually reduces the loss of power since subjects whose observations are limited to the interim TNPT because of early study termination will be taken into account when estimates are made of treatment effects at the final TNPT. Therefore, the mixed model will include mean LSS at interim and final TNPT as dependent variable as well as treatment group, visit and treatment group-visit interaction as fixed factor and baseline mean LSS as covariate.

For this purpose, the number of IMP-related TEAEs will be divided by the number of patient years observed in the study. The number of patient years is the sum of the individual observation periods, where the observation period for a patient is the time between start of treatment and (premature) study discontinuation or end of treatment, whichever is earlier. The incidence rate will be reported together with exact two-sided 95% CIs. For calculation of the 95% CIs, it is assumed that the number of AEs observed in the study is Poisson distributed. If any IMP-related serious TEAE or unacceptable AE occurs, the analysis will be repeated for these kinds of AEs. The required 95% CIs can be obtained by a variation of the following SAS-code: IMPTEAE IMPTEAE  95CI 95CIAEPoisson IMPTEAEAEAE SAS95CI proc genmod data=&lt;dataset name&gt;; class &lt;AE term&gt;; model &lt;number of events per patient year&gt; = &lt;AE term&gt; / dist=poisson link=log offset=&lt;log(1 patient year)&gt;; store out=insmodel; run; proc plm source=insmodel; score data=&lt;dataset name&gt; out=inspred pred stderr lclm uclm / nooffset ilink; run; 38.3.4 NICCAM A randomized, single blind, placebo controlled, parallel-arm study to investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Niclosamide and Camostat alone and in combination to treat Covid-19 (NICCAM) Covid-19 NICCAM 38.3.4.1 Study Design Investigational Medicinal Products Camostat (Foipan Ono Pharmaceutical OR Nichi-Iko Pharmaceutical) 100 mg capsules or tablets, active ingredient: Camostat mesilate Niclosamide (Yomesan® Bayer Vital GmbH) 500 mg chewing tablets, active ingredient: Niclosamide This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm single center trial in three cohorts.

Best treatment option n=20 Best treatment option is selected according to following priorities: First choice: Combination Niclosamide 2g QD + Camostat 600 TID if both treatments have proven safe in cohorts 1+2 OR (second choice): Combination niclosamide 2 g QD + Camostat 300 TID OR (third choice): Niclosamide alone if Camostat dosing has not proven to be safe during cohorts 1+2 OR Camostat alone if Niclosamide has not proven to be safe during cohorts 1+2. Patient number for this third choice is n=20 minus the number of patients already enrolled for the respective treatment from cohorts 1 and 2. H. Placebo n=4 Sample size (Justifications ) No formal sample size calculation has been performed. N=20 for treatment and placebo seems large enough to have an initial safety and efficacy assessment. Next to a budgetary constraint to sample size, there is also an ethical constraint to not treat with inefficacious medicines. 38.3.4.2 Primary Objective Primary Objective To assess the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of Camostat and of the treatment combination Niclosamide and Camostat in mild to moderately affected Covid-19 patients. Exploratory objectives To assess the preliminary efficacy (proof of concept) of Camostat in two ascending doses and of Niclosamide at 2 g QD, each substance alone and both substances in combination in mild to moderately affected Covid-19 patients over a 7 day treatment period. 38.3.4.3 Statistical Analysis The primary endpoint of the study is safety. Safety will be evaluated according to the following parameters: Adverse event monitoring - AEs and SAEs Physical examination Vital sign monitoring (blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation) Safety lab including coagulation All medical terms reported as adverse events (AE) are coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) for safety analysis. At least the primary System Organ class (SOC) as well as the Preferred Term (PT) will be available for the statistical analysis. Incidences of AEs will be summarized by intensity and relationship to the study drug. Baseline characteristics as well as efficacy outcomes will be evaluated descriptively, by appropriate summary measures of the empirical distribution as well as 95% confidence intervals and descriptive two-sided p-values comparing the treatment groups. 38.4 Phase III Trials Design 38.4.1 Introduction Phase III clinical trials are the gold standard to demonstrate the effects of an experimental therapy compared to standard therapy for a disease of interest. The first step when planning a phase III trial is to specify the statistical hypothesis that the trial purports to test, which is usually that the experimental therapy provides some efficacy benefit over standard therapy, without adding significant harm. In a phase III trial, a pre-specified number of patients from the target population are randomized to receive experimental or standard therapy. The patients are treated and followed up according to a protocol that also defines the endpoints of interest, in particular the primary endpoint which is chosen to reflect a clinical benefit of experimental therapy over standard therapy. The trial data are typically monitored by an independent committee who may recommend stopping the trial early, if appropriate. The benefit of experimental therapy over standard therapy, if any, may be observed across all patients, or may be confined to a subset of patients. IIIIIIIII 38.4.2 MG-III-001 38.4.2.1 Study Design This study is a retrospective, blinded analysis of archival tissue and corresponding clinical data using the MelaGenix® GEP. The archival tissue and corresponding clinical data will be collected from up to 10 study sites. Primary tumor tissue in FFPE blocks from up to 700 patients with histologically confirmed AJCC substages IIIA, IIIB or IIIC resectable cutaneous melanoma will be analyzed. The aim of this study is to validate the performance of MelaGenix® as an independent prognostic factor for estimating 5-year melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and to demonstrate that the survival rate of patients classified as MelaGenix® low risk is significantly higher than that of patients classified as MelaGenix® high risk, for AJCC substages: IIIA, IIIB and IIIC respectively.

Secondary Endpoints Relapse-free survival (RFS) is defined as the time (in months) from the date of initial diagnosis until the first local, regional/nodal, or distant relapse; Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) is defined as the time (in months) from the date of initial diagnosis until the first distant metastasis. 38.4.2.3 Statistical Analysis Primary Endpoint The Log-Rank test stratified by study site will be used to assess each hypothesis described in Section 2.5 to evaluate differences of MSS between MelaGenix® Low Risk and MelaGenix® High Risk in AJCC substages. The family-wise error-rate will be maintained using the Bonferroni-Holm procedure to perform the tests in the substages IIIA, IIIB and IIIC. The one-sided significance levels at interim and final are calculated to \\(\\alpha\\) interim = 0.0222 and \\(\\alpha\\) final = 0.0120, respectively. The following sequence of primary tests shows the Bonferroni-Holm procedure of the interim analysis using \\(\\alpha\\) interim = 0.0222. The final analysis is based on a completely similar procedure using \\(\\alpha\\) final = 0.0120. For interim analysis, the stratified Log-Rank test will be first carried out at the level of \\(\\alpha\\) interim/3 = 0.0074 for each substage, then the 3 p-values will be sorted into order lowest-to-highest P1, P2, P3 with their corresponding null hypotheses H1, H2, H3. If P1 &lt; 0.0074 (\\(\\alpha\\) interim/3), then H1 will be rejected and continue to the next step, otherwise exit the Bonferroni-Holm procedure (no further hypothesis testing) and the familywise error rate is under control. If P2 &lt; 0.0111 (\\(\\alpha\\) interim/2), then H2 will be rejected and continue to the next step, otherwise exits the Bonferroni-Holm procedure and the familywise error rate is under control. In the last step, P3 will be compared with interim. If P3 &lt; \\(\\alpha\\) interim, then H3 will be rejected, and the study will stop early. The plots of the survival curves with at-risk numbers between MelaGenix® Low Risk and MelaGenix® High Risk in AJCC substages IIIA, IIIB and IIIC will be provided.

Therefore, the cumulative incidence function will be used to estimate melanoma-specific events, which is the cumulative probability of failure from a specific cause over time, and will be presented by MelaGenix® Risk Group for each AJCC substage as a sensitivity analysis for the primary analysis. Melanoma-related death will be defined as status = 1. Death not related to melanoma will be considered a competing event (defined as status = 2). Patients lost to follow-up or without an event at the end of the observation period will be censored at the last date with information (last contact, censored data will be defined as status = 0). proc lifetest data=MSS_Dummy alpha = 0. 0.0074 plots=CIF(test) timelist=0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0; time Days*Status(0)/eventcode=1; strata Group / order=internal; run; Prognostic factor analyses For primary analysis (MSS) and secondary analyses (RFS, DMFS), the cause-specific hazard regression and the subdistribution hazard regression by Fine and Gray (1999) will be used to model the impact of prognostic factors on MSS, RFS and DMFS in AJCC substages IIIA, IIIB and IIIC patients. Cause-specific hazard regression Cause-specific hazard represents instantaneous risk from a specific event, which assumes that each event type (e.g. MSS and other death) has its own hazard model, which also controls the occurrence and timing of that type of event. No matter which type of incident occurs first, individuals no longer face other types of risks. The prognostic factor analyses are conducted in non-confirmatory. The following pseudo-SAS code introduces the modelling of cause-specific hazard regression given prognostic factors in the interim analysis. The hazard ratios and 95% profile-likelihood confidence intervals of these covariates will be reported. Moreover, as the proportional hazard regression, the diagnostics based on weighted residuals (Schoenfeld) will be shown. proc phreg data=MSS_Dummy zph; class group pt pn sex; model Days*Status(02)group pt pn sex age /rl alpha = 0.05; run; Subdistribution hazard regression The proportional subdistribution hazards model proposed by Fine and Gray (1999) is based on the cumulative incidence function given event, which is defined as the instantaneous rate of occurrence of a given event type in subjects who have not yet experienced the event type. proc phreg data=MSS_Dummy zph plots(overlaystratum)cif; model Days*Status(02)group pt pn sex age /eventcode=1 rl alpha = 0.05; run; 38.4.3 MEDIWOUND1 38.4.3.1 Study Design Study Synoposis IMP NexoBrid Active Ingredient Partially purified Bromelain  Study NexoBridGelStandard of Care Clinical Phase III Sample 331175NexoBridSOC A multicenter, multinational, randomized, controlled, assessor blinded study, performed in subjects with thermal burns, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NexoBrid compared to Gel Vehicle and compared to Standard of Care NexoBridGelStandard of Care 38.4.3.2 Primary Objective Incidence of complete eschar removal- Demonstrate superiority of NexoBrid over Gel Vehicle for eschar removal as measured by incidence of complete eschar removal at the end of the topical agent soaking period by a blinded assessor. -NexoBrid Efficacy evaluation Primary target variable Incidence of complete eschar removal in the topical arms (NexoBrid and Gel Vehicle): Incidence of complete eschar removal (ER) 38.4.3.3 Statistical Analysis logistices//yes / no(Using the exact statement in the SAS procedure PROC LOGISTIC).

The first method is a proportional hazards model which adopts a marginal approach with a working independence assumption. This model can be fitted by SAS PROC PHREG with the robust sandwich estimate option. The second method is a likelihood-based random effects (frailty) model. In the second model, the baseline hazard could be either a priori determined (e.g., Weibull) or approximated by piecewise constant counterpart. The estimation could be carried out by adaptive Gaussian quadrature method which is implemented in SAS PROC NLMIXED.

Approximately 20 healthy volunteers who meet all eligibility criteria will undergo 48-hour Treatment Period. During the Treatment Period of 48-hours, healthy volunteers will receive a sensitivity test (patch test) with HM242-Solution and HM242-Gel on the inner part of their upper arms. Inner part of the upper arms will be followed for approximately 10 days after patch test application. All patients will receive an occlusive patch per treatment as follows: Treatment 1: IMD1 (HM242-Solution) Treatment 2: IMD2 (HM242-Gel) Treatment 3: IMD1 and IMD2 Treatment 4: Sensitivity control (sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS )) Treatment 5: Negative control HM242-SolutionHM242-Gel  20**4848HM242-Solution HM242-Gel 10 Investigational Medical Device MD1 = HM242-Solution HM242 Solution HM242-Solution IMD2 = HM242-Gel HM242-Gel Screening failures Screening failures and subjects withdrawing prior to application of treatments will be replaced.

Primary Variable Occurrence of related AEs from Study Start until the End of Study (EoS) Secondary Objectives Local tolerability assessment by investigator 38.5.2.3 Statistical Analysis The main criterion of this clinical study is to analyse the frequency of adverse events that are related to the IMDs (ADEs). For this purpose, summary statistics for absolute and relative frequency (n, %) of ADEs will be calculated overall for each treatment, as well as by worst relationship to the study device, worst intensity and outcome for the SES. The analysis described above will be repeated for all observed AEs, i.e. including those not related to the medical device(s) in the investigators opinion. The time to first ADE will further be displayed in a Kaplan-Meier curve, including subjects that did not experience an event prior to terminating the study as censored information. As an additional analysis and to confirm that the observational period was sufficiently long, the number of ADEs and AEs per study day will be tabulated and displayed in figures. The analyses described above will be performed by treatment location.

Wound care is performed on at least one day per week by qualified personnel. Patients are followed-up until 35 days after randomization. Wound area is assessed by the Investigator. For patients with more than one venous ulcer, the larger eligible one is enrolled in the trial HM242-GelINTRASITE Gel 14211HM242-GelINTRASITE Gel71  35   Safety Evaluation Set (SES): The SES includes all study patients who have received the investigational device or the control device. For the analysis with the SES population, patients will be allocated to treatment group they actually received, rather than they were randomized to. Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT): The mITT includes all randomized patients with at least one post-baseline measurement of the primary endpoint. For the analysis with the mITT population, patients will be allocated to the treatment group they were randomized to, following the intent-to-treat principle. Per-protocol Set (PPS): The PPS includes all patients of the mITT that completed the study without major protocol deviations. 38.5.3.2 Sample Size Sample size determination is based on the hypotheses described below. While non-inferiority is an acceptable outcome for this study, the study will be powered to show superiority in case the observed difference between INTRASITE Gel and HM242-Gel is as large as expected. In a 2006 study, de la Brassinne et al. investigated the treatment effect of the alginate gel Flaminal vs. Intrasite (comparator in this study) in chronic leg ulcers. They reported a relative wound size reduction of approximately 19.4% in the Intrasite group after 28 days.With an expected difference of 20% in favor of the HM242-Gel regarding the primary endpoint, a common standard deviation of 40% and a desired power of 80%, the necessary number of patients to be included for testing superiority (using a one-sided t-test with a type I error rate of 2.5%) is 128 patients in total (64 in each treatment arm). Including a dropout rate of 10%, 142 patients will be enrolled in this study to result in 128 evaluable patients.

The primary variable is defined as the relative reduction of the wound area of a patient in percentage 28 days (4 weeks) after baseline. The wound size area is measured on site by the tracing method. Secondary Variables Performance: Wound size reduction (measured in cm²) during the study, taking into account individual weekly measurements Percentage of patents with wound size reduction of at least 20/50/70/90% after 28 days Time to wound size reduction of at least 20/50/70/90% Number of wound infections Time of dressing change per visit per patient () Amount of wound exudation () BWAT score at each scheduled visit Frequency of dressing changes Quality of Life (QoL) Wound QoL Questionnaire at visit 1 and after 4 weeks Wound pain using a VAS score at each visit before treatment Secondary Variables Safety: Occurrence of (treatment emergent) Adverse Events during the study Device-related Adverse Events 38.5.3.4 Statistical Analysis Test decision is based on the lower limit of a two-sided 95%-CI obtained by a linear regression modelling the wound size reduction in percent. Age, wound size at baseline, diabetes status at baseline (i.e., if a patient has diabetes or not), smoking behavior in pack years and treatment group will be used as covariates. The country in which the respective site resides in will be used as random effect. The analysis will be based on the mITT using the primary strategy for intercurrent events and repeated as sensitivity analysis for the PPS population. 95-CI  / mITTPPS 38.5.4 HM242-Solution Prospective, controlled, randomized, double-blind, premarket multi-centre study on the performance of HM242-Solution vs comparator in patients under condition of venous leg ulcer 38.5.4.1 Study Design This is a prospective, controlled, randomized, open-label premarket multi-centre study on the performance of HM242-Solution versus comparator (Saline  0.9% NaCl solution) in patients under condition of venous leg ulcer. 142 patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive either HM242-Solution or Saline in a 1:1 manner (71 patients per group). Wound care will be performed on at least one day per week by qualified personnel. Patients will be followed-up until 28 days after randomization. Wound area is assessed by the investigator.

The interim analysis will be performed without an upstream data review meeting and without the requirement to stop recruitment for the interim analysis. Aim of the interim analysis is to check the assumption of the sample size calculation. If the results are promising but the conditional power less than 80%, a sample size recalculation will be conducted, following the method described by Chen et al. (2004). For this purpose, the conditional power for rejecting the primary endpoint (for non-inferiority and superiority hypotheses, if applicable) will be calculated. Calculation of the conditional power will conservatively be based on a t-test. An increase in sample size given a conditional power of greater than 0.48 will not inflate the type I error rate of the trial. The safety of the IMD will also be assessed during the interim analysis to allow for an updated assessment of the benefit-risk-ratio. &gt; 4060 80Chen 2004t0.48I IMD 38.5.4.3 Primary Objective Primary Objective The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that the HM242-Solution performs at least comparably to Saline regarding wound healing. A hierarchical testing procedure will be used, first testing for non-inferiority and subsequently testing for superiority of HM242-Solution over Saline in relative reduction of the wound area in percentage 28 days (4 weeks) after baseline. The corresponding hypotheses for the analysis of the primary variable are the following: \\(H_{0N}\\): \\(\\mu_{HM242}\\) - \\(\\mu_{Saline}\\) \\(\\le\\) \\(\\zeta\\) (Null hypothesis) \\(H_{0N}\\): \\(\\mu_{HM242}\\) - \\(\\mu_{Saline}\\) \\(\\gt\\) \\(\\zeta\\) (Alternative hypothesis) If the non-inferiority null hypothesis is rejected, the primary endpoint will subsequently be tested for superiority using the following hypotheses: \\(H_{0N}\\): \\(\\mu_{HM242}\\) - \\(\\mu_{Saline}\\) \\(\\le\\) 0 (Null hypothess) \\(H_{0N}\\): \\(\\mu_{HM242}\\) - \\(\\mu_{Saline}\\) \\(\\gt\\) 0 (Alternative hypothesis) Since the confirmatory hypotheses are tested in a hierarchic manner, no adjustment for multiple testing is required. Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives are to further assess the performance of HM242-Solution, the quality of life for patients treated with the investigational product and to assess the safety of the investigational product. () 38.5.4.4 Statistical Analysis The primary endpoint, i.e. the relative change of wound area after 28 days (as defined in sect. 7.3.4), will not be tested confirmatory at the interim analysis. At the interim analysis, the assumption for the sample size calculation of the primary endpoint will be checked. Stopping and continuing rules that preserved the type-I-error are as following 287.3.4I The following binding decision rules are stated: If the conditional power of the non-inferiority hypothesis is lower than 50%, the trial will be stopped due to futility. If the conditional power of the non-inferiority hypothesis is higher than 50% and the conditional power of the superiority hypothesis is lower than 50% the trial will continue without sample size adjustments to keep the type I error controlled. If the conditional power of the superiority hypothesis is higher than 50% but under 80%, the sample size will be recalculated to achieve an overall power of 80% using the information gathered thus far by the end of the trial. If the conditional power of the superiority hypothesis is higher than 80% the trial will also continue without sample size adjustments. The threshold for the conditional power of 50% is used, as this procedure will not inflate the type-I-error (Chen et al. 2004). The primary endpoint will be evaluated testing the hypotheses stated in section 2.5 in a confirmatory way at the final analysis. The test decision will be based on the lower limit of a 95%-confidence interval that will be obtained by using a linear regression modelling the wound area reduction in percent. Covariates for this model will be age, wound area at baseline, diabetes status at baseline (i.e. if a patient has diabetes or not), smoking behaviour in pack years and treatment group. 2.595 38.5.4.5 Explorative Subgroup Analyses To investigate the impact of the intercurrent events (see section7.5.1) on the wound area reduction, statistical models will be used. To evaluate the impact of wound infections on the wound area reduction after 28 days the model \\[E(Y)= _0+_T X_T+_{Diab}X_{Diab}+_{WI}X_{WI}\\] will be used. E(Y) is the expected _0 denotes the overall average wound size at baseline, X_T is the treatment arm, _T the respective treatment effect, X_{Diab} is the diabetes status, _{Diab} is the effect of the diabetes status and X_{WI} indicates wound infections with _{WI} being its effect. , 28 38.6 Postmarketing Surveillance (PMS) 38.6.1 Phase IV and PMS Studies the side effects caused over time by a new treatment after it has been approved and is on the market. These trials look for side effects that were not seen in earlier trials and may also study how well a new treatment works over a long period of time.   Postmarketing surveillance (PMS), also known as post-market surveillance, is the practice of monitoring the safety of a pharmaceutical drug or medical device after it has been released on the market and is an important part of the science of pharmacovigilance. Since drugs and medical devices are approved on the basis of clinical trials, which involve relatively small numbers of people who have been selected for this purpose  meaning that they normally do not have other medical conditions that may exist in the general population  postmarketing surveillance can further refine, or confirm or deny, the safety of a drug or device after it is used in the general population by large numbers of people who have a wide variety of medical conditions.  Postmarketing surveillance uses a number of approaches to monitor drug and device safety, including spontaneous reporting databases, prescription event monitoring, electronic health records, patient registries, and record linkage between health databases.

CEEDOF ICLUCNVA 48 6 IOLEVO + Visian ICLEDOF 38.6.6.2 Interim Analysis According to Flemings two-stage design, an interim analysis will be performed to assess the responder rate in the first 27 enrolled subjects (54 eyes) with implantation of the investigational study device that have an assessment of monocular UNVA 6 months after implantation. If there are 43 or less responses among the 54 eyes, the trial will be stopped for futility. If there are 48 or more responses observed at the interim analysis, the trial will be stopped, and the null hypothesis rejected. If the number of responders at the interim analysis is greater than 43 and lower than 48, the trial will be continued and an additional 16 subjects (32 eyes) will be investigated. During the interim analysis, only the primary and secondary endpoint(s), selected additional performance variables, demographic parameters and baseline characteristics as well as all safety variables will be analysed. For the secondary endpoints and additional performance variables, only a comparison of Preoperative Visit and Postoperative Visit 5 will be performed at the interim analysis. All recorded data will be listed for the interim analysis. In case of an early termination at the interim analysis, all patients enrolled in the trial that did not yet complete the study according to the protocol (e.g. subjects that were enrolled to account for 10% dropouts) will continue with the visit schedule as planned. Once all enrolled subjects have terminated the study and their data have been collected, an additional analysis of the accumulated, final study data will be performed. The same would apply to the statistical analysis after completion of stage 2 of Flemings two-stage design. In more detail, the primary endpoint will be evaluated with the data for the 86 eyes required to complete stage 2 of Flemings two-stage design, and in case of more than 86 eyes in the FAS, the analysis will be repeated with all eyes in the FAS. In the event that the results for the final statistical analysis contradict the outcome after completion of stage 1 (only in case of early termination) or stage 2 of Flemings two-stage design, a detailed discussion of these contradictions, including potential reasons and their implication, will be included in the Clinical Study Report.

Flemings two-stage design was used to allow for early termination of the study at an interim analysis for futility or performance. An interim analysis will be performed with the first 54 eyes for which data is available for the primary endpoint. If there are 43 or less responses (79.63%), the trial will be stopped for futility. If there are 48 or more responses (88.89%) observed at the interim analysis, the trial will be stopped, and the null hypothesis rejected. Otherwise, 16 additional patients (32 eyes) will be recruited for a total of 43 patients (86 eyes). The null hypothesis will be rejected if 73 or more responses (84.88%) are observed at the final analysis. In addition, the two-sided Clopper-Pearson confidence interval will be provided for the observed responder rate. To allow for comparability with Flemings two-stage design, the pre-defined alpha for the respective stage (interim, final analysis) will be used.

While Phase IIV clinical studies examine the efficacy of a study product in a patient population according to clinical study protocol, non-interventional studies treat patients in daily clinical practice under real conditions. In an NIS, the researcher sets out to exert as little influence as possible on the patients condition while studying a medicines effectiveness, safety and tolerability under real life conditions (Mishra &amp; Vora, 2010). One of the major benefits of NIS is to take a trial out of the tightly controlled, laboratory setting of the clinical trial. Non-interventional studies give researchers an opportunity to see how a drug or procedure performs in real-life situations. External validity (the ability of a study to be generalized to the real-world) tends to be higher with non-interventional trials compared to clinical trials. IIV NIS.

The following exploratory goals were defined for this study: Symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections over the observation period Investigation of possible risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infections 38.7.2.4 Statistical Analysis The main target variable is the event of an acute and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection during the survey period (four weeks) measured by a PCR test and IgG antibody test after 5 weeks (taking into account a mean incubation time of 7 days). As a secondary target variable, possible risk factors for a SARS-CoV-2 infection are examined. The incidence is shown for each group (public transport and private transport) with absolute and relative frequencies. Confidence intervals for the respective estimators are given. In addition, the respective rates and the influence of group membership are examined with the aid of a Poisson regression, whereby the duration of the journey is taken into account as the exposure time. The initial epidemiological and demographic situation of the study participants is explored for possible risk factors with the help of regressions.    38.8 Trials Design (Phase II) 38.8.1 Flemings Two-Stage design One-Sample Multiple Testing Procedure for Phase II Clinical Trials II pIINSp = S / Np p It is the purpose of this report to inspect a one-sided multiple testing procedure and compare its behavior with that of the obvious single-stage test procedure, as well as with that of other multiple testing procedures which are currently employed for such decisions. Note that, as opposed to a single-stage procedure, in a multiple testing procedure patients accrue in several stages, testing being performed at each stage after appropriate patient accrual has been completed. Such a procedure has the property that patient accruat could be terminated, and a final decision reached, after any test. This feature is particularly appealing in a clinical setting where there are compelling ethical reasons to terminate a Phase II trial early if the initial proportion of patients experiencing a tumor regression is low. II Single\"Stage Procedure The single-stage procedure can be based upon the statistic \\(\\hat{p}=S / N\\), by rejecting \\(H_{0}\\) whenever \\(\\hat{p}\\) is large. Hence, the required sample size \\(N\\) can be determined by observing that \\(S\\) has a binomial distribution, \\(\\operatorname{Bin}(N, p) ;\\) i.e. \\(\\operatorname{pr}(S=x)=\\left(\\frac{N}{x}\\right) p^{x}(1-p)^{N-x}\\) for \\(x=\\) \\(0,1,2, \\ldots, N\\). Alternatively, one can observe that, for \\(N p \\geqslant 10, \\quad Y(p) \\equiv\\) \\((S-N p) /\\{N p(1-p)\\}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) has approximately a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance. The single-stage procedure would then reject \\(H_{0}\\) whenever \\(Y\\left(p_{0}\\right)&gt;Z_{1-\\alpha} ;\\) i.e. whenever \\(S \\geqslant N p_{0}+Z_{1-\\alpha}\\left\\{N p_{0}\\left(1-p_{0}\\right)\\right\\}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), where \\(Z_{u}\\) denotes the \\(u\\) -quantile of the normal distribution. It is straightforward to show that the sample size required for this singlestage procedure to have significance level \\(\\alpha\\) and power \\(1-\\beta\\) is approximately \\[ \\left.N=\\mathbf{(}\\left[Z_{1-\\beta}\\left\\{p_{\\mathrm{A}}\\left(1-p_{\\mathrm{A}}\\right)\\right\\}^{\\frac{1}{2}}+Z_{1-\\alpha}\\left\\{p_{0}\\left(1-p_{0}\\right)\\right\\}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right] /\\left(p_{\\mathrm{A}}-p_{0}\\right)\\right)^{2} \\] \\(S\\) has a discrete binomial distribution rather than a continuous normal distribution. In fact, calculations have shown that, to avoid the possibility of obtaining an anti-conservative test procedure as a result of this discreteness, the single-stage procedure should more appropriately reject \\(H_{0}\\) whenever \\[ S \\geqslant\\left[N p_{0}+Z_{1-\\alpha}\\left\\{N p_{0}\\left(1-p_{0}\\right)\\right\\}^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\right]^{*}+1, \\] Mulfiple Testing Procedures  Suppose that one decides to perform \\(K\\) tests and to allow \\(n_{i}\\) patients to accrue between the \\((i-1)\\) th and \\(i\\) th tests, so \\(N \\equiv n_{1}+\\cdots+n_{K}\\). Let \\(s_{1}\\), \\(i=1, \\ldots, K\\), represent the number of regressions among the \\(n_{i}\\) patients, so \\(S=\\) \\(s_{1}+\\cdots+s_{K} .\\) Furthermore, denote the set of acceptance points (of \\(H_{0}\\) ) by \\(\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{K}\\right)\\) and the set of rejection points (of \\(H_{0}\\) ) by \\(\\left(r_{1}, r_{2}, \\ldots, r_{K}\\right)\\). Setting \\(a_{K}=r_{K}-1\\), Schultz et al. (1973) defined the general multiple testing procedure as follows.

If the numbers of patients studied in the first and second stage are denoted by \\(n_{1}\\) and \\(n_{2}\\) respectively, then the expected sample size is \\(\\mathrm{EN}=n_{1}+(1-\\) PET) \\(n_{2}\\), where PET represents the probability of early termination after the first stage. The decision of whether or not to terminate after the first stage will be based on the number of responses observed for those \\(n_{1}\\) patients. The expected sample size EN and the probability of early termination depend on the true probability of response \\(p\\). We will terminate the experiment at the end of the first stage and reject the drug if \\(r_{1}\\) or fewer responses are observed. This occurs with probability PET \\(=B\\left(r_{1} ; p, n_{1}\\right)\\), where \\(B\\) denotes the cumulative binomial distribution. We will reject the drug at the end of the second stage if \\(r\\) or fewer responses are observed. Hence the probability of rejecting a drug with success probability \\(p\\) is \\[ B\\left(r_{1} ; p, n_{1}\\right)+\\sum_{x=r_{1}+1}^{\\min \\left[n_{1}, r\\right]} b\\left(x ; p, n_{1}\\right) B\\left(r-x ; p, n_{2}\\right), \\] where \\(b\\) denotes the binomial probability mass function. For specified values of \\(p_{0}, p_{1}, \\alpha\\), and \\(\\beta\\) we have determined optimal designs by enumeration using exact binomial probabilities. For each value of total sample size \\(n\\) and each value of \\(n_{1}\\) in the range \\((1, n-1)\\) we determined the integer values of \\(r_{1}\\) and \\(r\\), which satisfied the two constraints and minimized the expected sample size when \\(p=p_{0}\\). This was found by searching over the range \\(r_{1} \\in\\left(0, n_{1}\\right)\\). For each value of \\(r_{1}\\) we determined the maximum value of \\(r\\) that satisfied the type 2 error constraint. We then examine whether that set of parameters \\(\\left(n, n_{1}, r_{1}, r\\right)\\) satisfied the type 1 error constraint. If it did, then we compared the expected sample size to the minimum achieved by previous feasible designs and continued the search over \\(r_{1}\\). Keeping \\(n\\) fixed we searched over the range of \\(n_{1}\\) to find the optimal two-stage design for that maximum sample size \\(n\\). The search over \\(n\\) ranged from a lower value of about \\[ \\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})\\left[\\frac{z_{1-\\alpha}+z_{1-\\beta}}{p_{1}-p_{0}}\\right]^{2} \\] where \\(\\vec{p}=\\left(p_{0}+p_{1}\\right) / 2\\). We checked below this starting point to ensure that we had determined the smallest maximum sample size \\(n\\) for which there was a nontrivial \\(\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}&gt;0\\right)\\) two-stage design that satisfied the error probability constraints. The enumeration procedure searched upwards from this minimum value of \\(n\\) until it was clear that the optimum had been determined. The minimum expected sample size for fixed \\(n\\) is not a unimodal function of \\(n\\) because of discreteness of the underlying binomial distributions. Nevertheless, eventually as \\(n\\) increased the value of the local minima increased and it was clear that a global minimum had been found. ph2simon(pu, pa, ep1, ep2, nmax=100) pu unacceptable response rate pa response rate that is desirable ep1 threshold for the probability of declaring drug desirable under p0 ep2 threshold for the probability of rejecting the drug under p1 knitr::include_graphics(&quot;./02_Plots/Simon_twoStage.PNG&quot;) Figure 38.1: Figure: Simons 2-Stage Design ## `ph2simon(pu, pa, ep1, ep2, nmax=100)` library(&quot;clinfun&quot;) Simon &lt;- ph2simon(0.2, 0.35, 0.05, 0.05, nmax=150) Simon ## ## Simon 2-stage Phase II design ## ## Unacceptable response rate: 0.2 ## Desirable response rate: 0.35 ## Error rates: alpha = 0.05 ; beta = 0.05 ## ## r1 n1 r n EN(p0) PET(p0) ## Optimal 11 50 28 109 67.07 0.7107 ## Minimax 15 68 25 95 75.44 0.7244 plot(Simon) Figure 38.2: Figure: Simons 2-Stage Design 38.8.3 Jonckheere-Terptsra (JT) trend test In some safety and efficacy studies, it is of interest to determine if an increase in the dose yields an increase (or decrease) in the response. The statistical analysis for such a situation is called a dose-response or trend analysis. We want to see a trend here, not just a difference in groups. Typically, patients in a dose-response study are randomized to K + 1 treatment groups (a placebo dose and K increasing doses of the drug). The response variables of interest may be binary, ordinal, or continuous (in some circumstances, the response variable may be a time-to-event variable). In some instances, trend tests can be sensitive and reveal a mild trend where pair-wise comparisons would not be able to find significant differences and not be as helpful.    K + 1K   For the sake of illustration, suppose that the response is continuous and that we want to determine if there is a trend in the K + 1 population means. K + 1 A one-sided hypothesis testing framework for investigating an increasing trend is \\[H_{0}: \\mu_{0}=\\mu_{1}=\\cdots=\\mu_{K}\\] versus \\[H_{1}: \\mu_{0} \\leq \\mu_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq \\mu_{K}\\] with at least one strict inequality} A one-sided hypothesis testing framework for investigating a decreasing trend is \\[H_{0}: \\mu_{0}=\\mu_{1}=\\cdots=\\mu_{K}\\] versus \\[H_{1}: \\mu_{0} \\geq \\mu_{1} \\geq \\cdots \\geq \\mu_{K}\\] with at least one strict inequality} A two-sided hypothesis testing framework for investigating a trend is \\[H_{0}: \\mu_{0}=\\mu_{1}=\\cdots=\\mu_{K}\\] versus \\[H_{1}: \\mu_{0} \\leq \\mu_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq \\mu_{K}\\] or \\[\\mu_{0} \\geq \\mu_{1} \\geq \\cdots \\geq \\mu_{K}\\] with at least one strict inequality} Jonckheere-Terptsra (JT) trend test For a continuous response, an appropriate test is the Jonckheere-Terptsra (JT) trend test that was developed in the 1950s. The JT trend test is based on a sum of Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests : \\[JT=\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\\sum_{k&#39;=1}^{K}MWW_{kk&#39;}\\] where \\(M W W_{, kk&#39;}\\) is the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for comparing group \\(\\mathrm{k}\\) to group \\(k^{\\prime}, 0 \\leq k&lt;k^{\\prime} \\leq K\\). Essentially, each of the pairs of groups is compared against one another and then summed up. In this way this test looks for trends. As an example of how the JT statistic is constructed, suppose there are four dose groups in a study (placebo, low dose, mid-dose, and high dose). Then the JT trend test is the sum of six Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test statistics. Next, we assume that the \\(K+1\\) groups have a homogeneous population variance, \\(\\sigma^{2}\\). The population variance is estimated by the pooled sample variance, \\(s^{2}\\), and it has d degrees of freedom: \\[ s^{2}=\\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k=0}^{K} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{k}}\\left(Y_{k i}-\\bar{Y}_{k}\\right)^{2}, d=\\sum_{k=0}^{K}\\left(n_{k}-1\\right) \\] Letting \\(c_{k}=2 k-K, k=0,1, \\ldots, K\\), the numerator reduces to \\[ \\sum_{k=0}^{K} c_{k} \\bar{Y}_{k} \\] Then the trend statistic is: \\[ T=\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{K} c_{k} \\bar{Y}_{k}\\right) /\\left(\\sqrt{s^{2} \\sum_{k=0}^{K} \\frac{c_{k}^{2}}{n_{k}^{2}}}\\right) \\] The T trend statistic can be constructed by using the CONTRAST statement in SAS PROC GLM. The JT trend test works well for binary and ordinal data, as well as being available for continuous data. Another trend test for binary data is the Cochran-Armitage (CA) trend test. The difference between the JT and CA trend tests is that for the latter test, the actual dose levels can be specified. In other words, instead of designating the dose levels as low, mid, or high, the actual numerical dose levels can be used in the CA trend test, such as 20 mg, 60, 180 mg.

This test is appropriate only when one variable has two levels and the other variable is ordinal. The two-level variable represents the response, and the other represents an explanatory variable with ordered levels. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis of no trend, which means that the binomial proportion is the same for all levels of the explanatory variable.

MCP-Mod (Multiple Comparisons Procedure - Modelling) is an increasingly popular statistical methodology. It can generate superior statistical evidence from Phase II trials with regards to dose selection. The FDA &amp; EMA both recently approved this as fit-for-purpose (FFP). MCP-Mod is a two-step approach for analyzing Phase II dose-finding data, targeting two of the main Phase II objectives: MCP-Mod- II FDAEMAFFPIIII Establish that the drug works as intended  Determine the appropriate doses for Phase III testing III MCP Robust but restricted to selected doses as nominal variable  Mod Flexible quantitative approach but reliant on model choice  MCP-Mod Design Stage: Select candidate models &amp; generate optimal tests  MCP Stage: Select best model(s) w/ appropriate contrasts but control FWER FWER Mod Stage: Model using best model and find target dose(s) of interest  The strength of MCP-Mod lies in providing flexibility in characterizing the expected dose-response curve by allowing multiple models to be evaluated at the same time while still giving results that are efficient and control the error rates. MCP-Mod MCP-Mod5 The first step (MCP-step) is used to assess the presence of a dose response signal using a trend test deducted from a set of pre-specified candidate models. MCP Define a suitable study population to represent the underlying true dose-response shape.  Pre-Specify the candidate dose response models based on available information. These are based on assessment of relevant metrics such as type I error rate, power to detect a significant dose-response shape, and the power to find the minimal effective dose.  I Dose determination and sample size calculation to achieve targeted performance characteristics.  The second step (Mod-step) relies on parametric modeling or model averaging to find the optimal dose for confirmatory trials.  Later, a candidate model is selected using model selection criteria like Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or averaging. AkaikeAICBIC Dose-response and target dose estimation based on selected models. (Mod part of MCP-Mod).  38.8.6 Two Stage Phase II Design for Response and Toxicity Phase II designs are often used to determine whether a new procedure or treatment is likely to meet a basic level of efficacy to warrant further development or evaluation. Phase IIa designs are focussed on the proof-of-concept part of Phase II trials. They aim to show the potential efficacy and safety of a proposed treatment. Two-stage designs are common to allow for flexibility to stop trials early for futility as Phase II is the most common failure point in drug evaluation. II IIaIIII The method outlined in Bryant and Day (1995). As mentioned, often evaluation of toxicity is listed as a primary objective in Phase IIa trials. The Bryant and Day design is a two stage phase IIa design with a coprimary endpoint which allows one to evaluate both the efficacy and the toxicity of the drug or treatment within a single design. Bryant and Day1995IIa BryantDayIIa Phase IIa methods like Simons Design looking for evidence of response and will stop early if no signal. Phase IIb changed significantly by combining robust MCP with modelling rather than separating these objectives 38.9 Trials Design (Phase III) 38.9.1 Non-inferiority and Equivalence Three-armed trial Non-inferiority testing is a common hypothesis test in the development of generic medicine and medical devices. The most common design compares the proposed non-inferior treatment to the standard treatment alone but this leaves uncertain if the treatment effect is the same as from previous studies. This assay sensitivity problem can be resolved by using a three-arm trial which includes placebo alongside the new and reference treatments for direct comparison.

Means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges will be computed for continuous variables, and sample probability mass functions computed for categorical factors. Histograms, scatter plots, and box plots will be used to assess skew and examine assumptions (such as normality) underlying statistical models. Baseline characteristics for the four randomized subcohorts will be compared using ANOVA for continuous variables and Fishers exact tests for categorical variables. Where appropriate, log or power transformations of outcome variables will be employed to enhance conformity with assumptions (e.g. normality in outcomes and/or linearity in associations between outcomes and covariates). Exploratory graphical assessment of the strength of association between covariates and outcome variables will be obtained via scatterplot smoothing using Generalized Additive Models. A preliminary assessment of the quantity and pattern of missing data will also be performed.

The stratified log-rank test without adjustments for covariates will be used in the primary evaluation of PFS differences between the experimental arm and the standard-of-care arm in the ITT analysis set using a one-sided,  = 0.025 level test. All events entered in the database at the time of analysis that have been source data-verified will be included in the analysis of PFS, even if there are more than the prespecified number of events. Kaplan-Meier Curves depicting PFS in the 2 arms will be generated. Additionally, median PFS and probability of PFS from 3 months to the end of the follow-up period will be reported at 3-month intervals.

Stratification will be by diabetes status.  4  8  Group A: Placebo injections weekly; 0.8 g/kg/day protein Group B: Placebo injections weekly; 1.3 g/kg/day protein Group C: Testosterone enanthate 100 mg intramuscularly weekly; 0.8 g  kg  day protein Group D: Testosterone enanthate 100 mg intramuscularly weekly; 1.3 g  kg  day protein The primary analysis of lean body mass will be performed in two parts. Our primary analytical strategy is to use mixed-effects regression analysis to assess 3 and 6 month outcomes simultaneously with baseline total body lean mass considered as a covariate, as is appropriate for between-group comparisons of randomized subcohorts, and 6-month differences between arms will be estimated via a treatment contrast and corresponding 95% confidence interval. We will also use a two-way ANOVA to compare change from baseline to 6-month across the four randomized subcohorts. We expect general agreement between estimates arising from Parts I and II, but owing to its use of all data, that from mixed effects regression analysis will be considered the principal estimate of treatment effect. Though the primary aim of the analysis will be to estimate treatment effects at 6-months, a linear trend in change with time will not be assumed, and the potential for differential mean trajectories in treatment effects over the entire duration of follow-up will be assessed via stratification and the use of statistical interaction terms. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons will assume an allowed type-I error probability of 0.05.  3  6  6  95%  6  I  II  6  I  0.05 Multiple Comparisons: We recognize that a number of hypotheses will be tested, which will increase the likelihood of committing a type 1 error. We are aware of many different approaches that can be used to adjust for multiple comparisons. A two -sided, 5% level of significance will be used for each pre-specified hypothesis and magnitude of effect size will be carefully evaluated for clinical significance. For exploratory hypotheses, we will adjust the p value by using the Boneferronis correction. It is still possible that we will find statistical significance in some instances when the differences are of little clinical significance. In such cases, the clinical importance of findings  whether the magnitude of treatment effect meets or exceeds the minimal clinically important difference in the outcome - will be highlighted in the interpretation of results.  1    5%   Boneferroni  p    Example 2 The primary efficacy variable is the change from Baseline in atrophic lesion area in the study eye. The primary analysis will use the mITT population and will be based on an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model that includes the treatment group and region as the factors and the baseline lesion area as the covariate. The least-squares means (LS means) for change from baseline will be calculated for each group. Statistical test for the between-group difference (Brimo DDS versus Sham) in LS means and the construction of the corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be done using the same ANCOVA model. If warranted, data transformation will be applied to the atrophic lesion area (such as the square root transformation), and the final statistical analysis for the change from baseline will be based on the transformed data.   mITT  (ANCOVA)  LS  LS Brimo DDS  Sham 2  95%  ANCOVA   38.11.9 Efficacy GLM Dose-Finding Study The primary endpoint of this dose-finding study is the cumulative number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions per patient on T1-weighted MRI scans at Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24.  121620  24  T1  MRI  The generalized linear model, with a log link function [Littell 2002], applied in the study for the primary analysis can be described as follows: \\[ \\mu_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\exp \\left(\\beta_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right) \\] \\(\\mu_{\\mathrm{i}}\\) expected value of \\(\\mathrm{y}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\), the observed number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions recorded on \\(\\mathrm{T}_{1}\\)-weighted MRI scans at Weeks \\(12,16,20\\), and 24 after study drug initiation of treatment group i \\(\\beta_{i}\\) the treatment effect. More specifically, the comparisons of each of the active dose groups with placebo on the primary endpoint are carried out by means of a negative binomial model with the treatment arm as a four-level classification explanatory variable, testing individual comparisons of each of the active treatments and placebo. The negative binomial distribution is introduced due to the nature of the data and to reflect the uncertainty about the true rates at which the number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions occur for individual patients [Sormani 1999].   [Sormani 1999] More specifically the probability of observing \\(y_{i}\\) lesions for each patient in the \\(i\\)-th treatment group at Weeks \\(12,16,20\\), and 24 is negative binomial with: \\[ \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\mathrm{y}_{\\mathrm{i}} ; \\mu_{\\mathrm{i}}, \\theta\\right)=\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(y_{i}+\\theta\\right)}{\\Gamma(\\theta) \\cdot y_{i} !} \\cdot \\frac{\\theta^{\\vartheta} \\cdot \\mu^{y_{i}}}{(\\theta+\\mu)^{\\left(\\theta+y_{i}\\right)}} \\] This distribution has \\(E(y)=\\mu_{i}\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Var}(y)=\\left(\\mu_{i}+\\mu_{i}^{2} / \\theta\\right)\\). Hypotheses and statistical inference The global null hypothesis is that none of the three active treatment groups differs from the placebo group for the mean cumulative number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions. The alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the active treatment groups differs from the placebo group.   The global null hypothesis is expressed as a family of null hypothesis H0i, defined as follows: \\[ \\begin{array}{l} \\mathrm{H}_{01}: \\mu_{1}=\\mu_{\\text {placebo }} \\\\ \\mathrm{H}_{02}: \\mu_{2}=\\mu_{\\text {placebo }} \\\\ \\mathrm{H}_{03}: \\mu_{3}=\\mu_{\\text {placebo }} \\end{array} \\] Where \\(\\mu_{\\mathrm{i}}\\) (with \\(\\mathrm{i}=1,2,3\\) ) corresponds to the mean number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions per patient on \\(\\mathrm{T}_{1}\\)-weighted MRI scans at Weeks \\(12,16,20\\), and 24 for each of the three active doses and \\(\\mu_{\\text {placebo }}\\) is the mean number for the placebo group. The Bonferroni-Holms procedure [Holm 1979] is adopted to control the global type I error set equal to \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) two-sided. This stepwise (step down) procedure is based on ordered \\(\\mathrm{p}\\)-values, and the corresponding hypotheses are rejected one at a time. The smallest p-value will be compared to the two-sided nominal significance level \\(0.0167\\). The power of this study to detect a reduction of \\(50 \\%\\) of the cumulative number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions in at least one of the active dose groups is set equal to \\(90 \\%\\). (i.e., the study-wise type II error of accepting all three null hypotheses when they are false is set equal to \\(0.10\\) ). The study has \\(90 \\%\\) power to detect a reduction of \\(50 \\%\\) in the cumulative number of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions in at least one of the ACT-128800 groups, as compared with the placebo group (i.e., a reduction from 8 to 4 lesions. The primary efficacy endpoint is summarized by the treatment group showing mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, quartiles, minimum and maximum, and 95% two-sided confidence limits of the mean and median. In addition, least-square estimates of treatment mean differences with the corresponding 95% two-sided confidence limits from the negative binomial regression model are presented. 38.11.10 Safety Analyses 38.11.10.1 Extent of Exposure Duration of treatment, number of cycles, total dose and dose intensity will be summarized by treatment arm using the safety analysis set.
